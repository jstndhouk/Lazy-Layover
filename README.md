# Lazy-Layover
![alt text](./assets/images/desktop.PNG)
## User Story
As a traveler that has a layover that may take longer then expected, I want to be able to see different options that are available around me so that I can make best of my time while I wait for my flight.

## Description
This application takes in the city of the airport and the duration of the layover and returns restaurants (and hotels if the duration is over 8 hours) and allows the user to click on a restaurant and visit that restaurants yelp page.  It also stores the most recent previous search so that the user can quickly navigate to previous results.

## Testing locally
There is a cors problem with the Yelp API. I've gone to the internet to try to resolve. It worked!
Please make sure to go to this url before tests: https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo
and request temporary demo access
